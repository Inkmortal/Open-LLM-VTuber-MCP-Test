## Current Status
**Phase**: ~~Planning~~ → ~~Implementation~~ → ~~Testing~~ → ~~Enhancement~~ → **Acceptable Implementation**
- Architecture analysis complete
- Integration strategy defined
- Core MCP implementation complete
- All major bugs fixed
- UX significantly improved
- MCP integration at acceptable levels
- Agent intelligence could be improved

## Known Issues
1. **Agent Intelligence**: While functional, the agent could be more autonomous in:
   - Exploring available tools without prompting
   - Constructing queries with inferred parameters
   - Recovering from errors with alternative approaches
   - Understanding implicit context
   - Planning complex multi-step operations

## Fixes Applied (2025-07-09)
1. **Initial Integration Issues**: 
   - Added 'mcp_agent' to allowed conversation_agent_choice in AgentConfig
   - Created MCPAgentConfig class with proper fields
   - Added mcp_agent to AgentSettings with descriptions
   - File: `src/open_llm_vtuber/config_manager/agent.py`

2. **MCP Connection Fixes**:
   - Fixed ClientSession context manager usage
   - Added support for both snake_case and camelCase attributes
   - Fixed CallToolResult JSON serialization
   - Generated tool call IDs for Gemini compatibility
   - Enabled multi-turn tool calling

3. **UX Improvements**:
   - Implemented tag-based content separation
   - Updated persona prompt with proactive behavior
   - Made thoughts use bullet points
   - Removed verbose tool narration

4. **Final Display Fixes**:
   - Fixed sentence_divider to recognize "thought" and "speak" tags
   - Removed non-functional action descriptions (::action::)
   - Updated asterisk filtering to preserve content
   - Achieved complete thought content hiding

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-09
1. **Chose Agent-Level Integration**: Decided to implement MCP at the agent level rather than creating a separate service to maintain modularity and reuse existing infrastructure

2. **Async-First Approach**: All MCP operations will be async to prevent blocking the real-time conversation flow

3. **Configuration in YAML**: MCP servers will be configured in the existing YAML system rather than a separate config file for consistency

### 2025-07-09
1. **Tag-Based Content Separation**: Implemented thought/speak tags to cleanly separate internal reasoning from user-facing content

2. **Removed Action Descriptions**: Eliminated non-functional ::action:: syntax since only [emotion] tags actually control Live2D

3. **Prioritized Function Over Form**: Focused on making the integration work correctly rather than perfect autonomous behavior

4. **Acceptable Implementation Achieved**: Determined that while improvements are possible, the current implementation meets functional requirements

## Next Session Focus
- Improve agent intelligence for autonomous tool usage
- Implement better query construction and parameter inference
- Add error recovery strategies
- Enhance multi-step planning capabilities
- Consider adding more MCP servers (web search, code assistance)
- Document usage patterns and best practices

## Teams Meeting Bot Development (2025-01-15)

### Architecture Research Complete ✅
1. **Evaluated Multiple Approaches**:
   - Native Bot Framework (too complex, requires Windows Server)
   - Pure browser automation (feasible but limited)
   - Hybrid approach with Graph API (optimal)

2. **Key Discoveries**:
   - Graph API only provides post-meeting transcripts
   - No real-time transcript API available
   - Chrome's fake audio/video flags load files once (not dynamic)
   - PulseAudio required for dynamic audio routing
   - v4l2loopback needed for virtual camera

3. **Final Architecture Decided**:
   - Three-channel monitoring (Audio, Chat, Captions)
   - Meeting bot as WebSocket client to VTuber server
   - Docker container with Playwright browser automation
   - PulseAudio for audio pipeline
   - DOM scraping for live captions (necessary evil)

4. **Implementation Plan Created**:
   - Phase 1: Audio/Video POC (highest risk)
   - Phase 2: Caption scraping with resilient selectors
   - Phase 3: WebSocket integration
   - Phase 4: TTS/Audio pipeline
   - Phase 5: Complete integration

See `meetingBotArchitecture.md` for complete technical details.

### Meeting Bot Implementation (2025-01-16) ✅

1. **v4l2loopback Approach Failed**:
   - Kernel module doesn't work in WSL2
   - Not available in cloud containers
   - User demanded fully containerized solution

2. **Breakthrough Discovery**:
   - Chrome's `--use-file-for-fake-video-capture` works with named pipes!
   - Tested and confirmed with Y4M format through FIFO
   - Enables fully userspace video streaming

3. **Cloud-Deployable Solution Implemented**:
   - Removed all v4l2loopback dependencies
   - Updated all Docker files to use named pipes
   - Created cloud-specific implementation files
   - No host dependencies required

4. **Clean Architecture**:
   ```
   VTuber Browser → FFmpeg Screen Capture → Named Pipe → Chrome Fake Video
   ```

5. **Files Created/Updated**:
   - `Dockerfile.cloud` - Clean Ubuntu base with Chrome
   - `stream_vtuber_to_pipe.py` - FFmpeg to pipe streaming  
   - `meeting_bot_cloud.py` - Chrome with pipe video
   - `docker-compose.cloud.yml` - Cloud deployment config
   - Cleaned up all v4l2loopback code from existing files

This solution can now be deployed to AWS, GCP, Azure, or any Docker platform without special kernel requirements.

### VTuber Docker Integration Complete (2025-01-17) ✅

1. **Canvas-based Virtual Camera Implementation**:
   - Replaced FFmpeg with JavaScript canvas manipulation
   - Direct frame injection via `captureStream()` API
   - No external processes or pipes needed
   - Full 30 FPS streaming achieved

2. **WebGL/Live2D Rendering Fixed**:
   - Root cause: Simple TCP proxy couldn't handle HTTP properly
   - PIXI.js and other JS dependencies failed to load
   - Solution: Implemented full HTTP/WebSocket proxy with aiohttp
   - Handles headers, CORS, and all resource types correctly

3. **Final Architecture**:
   ```
   VTuber (Windows) → HTTP/WS Proxy → Docker Browser → Canvas Virtual Camera → Meeting
   ```

4. **Key Fixes Applied**:
   - HTTP proxy with proper header forwarding
   - Mesa GLX libraries for WebGL support
   - SwiftShader for software rendering
   - Frame queue pattern for JS context isolation
   - Secure context via HTTP server (not file://)

5. **Working Components**:
   - ✅ VTuber character renders correctly
   - ✅ WebSocket connection maintained
   - ✅ Virtual camera streams at 30 FPS
   - ✅ All textures and models load
   - ✅ Live2D animations work
   - ✅ No kernel modules required

6. **Files Created**:
   - `run_virtual_camera_http_proxy.py` - Full HTTP/WebSocket proxy
   - Multiple iterations of virtual camera scripts
   - Diagnostic tools for WebGL testing

The solution is now production-ready for cloud deployment with full VTuber rendering in containerized environments.
