# Progress: MCP Integration for Open-LLM-VTuber

## What Works
- ✅ Base Open-LLM-VTuber application is functional
- ✅ Understood system architecture and extension points
- ✅ Identified agent system as best integration point
- ✅ Memory bank initialized with project context
- ✅ **MCP Integration Core Implementation Complete**

## What's Been Built
### Documentation
- Created comprehensive memory bank structure
- Documented system architecture and patterns
- Defined integration strategy and approach
- Captured technical requirements and constraints
- Created detailed MCP integration plan (mcp-integration-plan.md)

### Analysis Completed
- Explored codebase structure
- Understood message flow and processing pipeline
- Identified key interfaces and extension points
- Learned about MCP protocol and capabilities
- Researched industry standards for tool calling

### Implementation Completed (2025-07-09)
1. **Enhanced OpenAI-Compatible LLM** ✅
   - Added `supports_function_calling()` method
   - Enhanced `chat_completion()` with tools parameter
   - Implemented streaming tool call aggregation
   - Added graceful fallback for unsupported providers

2. **MCP Client Manager** ✅
   - Generic client manager supporting all MCP servers
   - Stdio and SSE transport support
   - Tool namespacing to prevent conflicts
   - Proper session lifecycle management

3. **MCPAgent Implementation** ✅
   - Extends BasicMemoryAgent seamlessly
   - Integrates with existing pipeline
   - Maintains streaming responses
   - Natural language tool result summaries

4. **Integration Complete** ✅
   - Agent factory updated
   - Configuration already in place
   - Ready to use without modifications

## What's Left to Build

### 1. ~~MCP Agent Implementation~~ ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `MCPAgent` class extending `BasicMemoryAgent`
- [x] Implement MCP client initialization
- [x] Add tool decision logic
- [x] Create tool execution pipeline
- [x] Handle tool responses in conversation flow

### 2. ~~MCP Configuration~~ ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Extend YAML schema for MCP settings
- [x] Create MCP server management logic
- [x] Add server discovery and initialization
- [x] Implement credential management (handled by mcp-remote)

### 3. Core Tool Integrations (Ready to Use)
- [x] File system access (configured in conf.yaml)
- [ ] Web search capability (needs MCP server)
- [x] Jira integration (via atlassian MCP server)
- [ ] Claude Code SDK integration (needs MCP server)

### 4. UI/UX Enhancements (Future Work)
- [ ] Add tool usage indicators
- [ ] Create Live2D expressions for tool usage
- [ ] Implement progress feedback for long operations
- [x] Add interrupt handling for tool operations (inherited)

### 5. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Unit tests for MCP agent
- [ ] Integration tests for tools
- [ ] User documentation
- [x] Configuration examples (in conf.yaml)

## Current Status
**Phase**: ~~Planning~~ → ~~Implementation~~ → **Testing Ready**
- Architecture analysis complete
- Integration strategy defined
- Core MCP implementation complete
- Ready for testing with configured servers

## Known Issues
1. ~~**MCP Package Dependency**: The `mcp` Python package needs to be installed~~ ✅ Added requirements-mcp.txt
2. **Async Start Method**: MCPAgent.start() is called in service_context.py with event loop handling

## Fixes Applied (2025-07-09)
1. **Config Validation Fixed**: 
   - Added 'mcp_agent' to allowed conversation_agent_choice in AgentConfig
   - Created MCPAgentConfig class with proper fields
   - Added mcp_agent to AgentSettings with descriptions
   - File: `src/open_llm_vtuber/config_manager/agent.py`

2. **Updated Persona Prompt**:
   - Enhanced default personality to mention tool capabilities
   - Made assistant more proactive about using tools
   - Maintains friendly VTuber personality

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-09
1. **Chose Agent-Level Integration**: Decided to implement MCP at the agent level rather than creating a separate service to maintain modularity and reuse existing infrastructure

2. **Async-First Approach**: All MCP operations will be async to prevent blocking the real-time conversation flow

3. **Configuration in YAML**: MCP servers will be configured in the existing YAML system rather than a separate config file for consistency

## Next Session Focus
Begin implementing the MCPAgent class with basic tool decision logic and MCP client initialization.
