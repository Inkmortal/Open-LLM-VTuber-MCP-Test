# Active Context: MCP Integration Development

## Current Status
- ✅ Explored and understood Open-LLM-VTuber architecture
- ✅ Learned about MCP (Model Context Protocol) capabilities
- ✅ Identified integration points in the codebase
- ✅ Created initial memory bank documentation
- ✅ **Implemented core MCP integration** (2025-07-09)
- Ready for testing

## Recent Implementation (2025-07-09)

### Architecture Understanding
1. **Agent System**: The VTuber uses an agent-based architecture with `AgentInterface` as the base
2. **Message Flow**: WebSocket → MessageHandler → Agent → LLM → Response Pipeline
3. **Extensibility**: System designed for modularity through interfaces and factories
4. **Configuration**: YAML-based config with support for multiple providers

### MCP Integration Strategy
Decided on agent-level integration approach:
- Create `MCPAgent` extending `BasicMemoryAgent`
- Add MCP configuration to YAML structure
- Implement tool decision and execution logic
- Maintain streaming and interrupt capabilities

## Implementation Complete

### What Was Built
1. **Enhanced OpenAI-Compatible LLM** ✅
   - Added function calling support to interface
   - Streaming tool call aggregation
   - Graceful fallback for unsupported providers

2. **MCP Client Manager** ✅
   - Generic support for all MCP servers
   - Tool namespacing (server.tool_name)
   - Proper session lifecycle management

3. **MCPAgent** ✅
   - Seamless extension of BasicMemoryAgent
   - Two-phase interaction (tools then summary)
   - Natural language responses for tool results

4. **Integration** ✅
   - Agent factory registration
   - Service context initialization
   - Configuration already in place

## Next Steps

### Testing Phase
1. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install mcp Python package
   - Verify Node.js and npx are available

2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - File system access via filesystem server
   - Jira access via atlassian server
   - Verify tool calls don't reach TTS

3. **Error Scenarios**
   - Test with unavailable MCP servers
   - Test with invalid tool arguments
   - Verify graceful degradation

### Design Decisions Made
1. **Agent-Level Integration**: MCP functionality lives in specialized agent to maintain modularity
2. **Async-First**: All MCP operations will be async to maintain real-time flow
3. **Configuration-Driven**: MCP servers defined in YAML for flexibility
4. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working if MCP fails

## Key Insights

### Technical Patterns
- The codebase uses decorators extensively for pipeline processing
- Async generators are used for streaming responses
- Factory pattern used for creating different implementations
- Strong separation between stateless LLMs and stateful agents

### Integration Opportunities
- Can leverage existing transformer pipeline for tool responses
- WebSocket infrastructure supports additional message types
- Configuration system easily extends for MCP settings
- Interrupt handling mechanism can be reused for tool cancellation

### Potential Challenges
1. **Streaming vs Tool Execution**: Need to maintain streaming while executing tools
2. **Context Length**: Tool results might increase context significantly
3. **UI Feedback**: Need clear indication of tool usage in Live2D model
4. **Error Recovery**: Complex error scenarios with multiple tool failures

## Project Context
This is a personal project to enhance the Open-LLM-VTuber with agentic capabilities. The main goal is to transform the VTuber from a conversational companion into an AI assistant that can perform actions through MCP tools while maintaining its personality and real-time interaction capabilities.
